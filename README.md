# Compiling & Running
Sadly, this only works on windows, because of windows.h, so if someone can convert the game for POSIX systems and maybe send a pull request that would be cool
## Compiling
### Deps
Visual Studio, C/C++ Support
### Instructions
Click on "Local Windows Debugger" or head to Build > Compile in Visual Studio
## Running
### Deps
Same deps as compiling
### Instructions
Press the green run button to run the game
# Notes
This was made in Visual Studio 2017 so you can really load it in a newer version otherwise you'll get some problems with the code

Controls are space for jumping... thats it.

If you are playing in Windows Terminal, it won't look good. So run it in an admin command prompt.

This runs completely in the terminal, Enjoy!
